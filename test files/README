################################### Test files #####################################

Each folder (except for the first) contains two files that should be input into the https://nmvis.azurewebsites.net/
site as described in the program manual to test for functionality and to verify that the
application works as expected.

Make sure to set the motif size indicated by the folder name when testing, else the motifs will not be displayed.
Also, make sure the graph file is provided as the first file in the form and the nemoCollect file as the second in the appropriate file input box.

Test 1: Tests only graph input, copy and past the graph into the field or attach the
	File. Display the graph. Selecting the motif size will have no effect.

Test 2: Size 3 motif
	Tests the input for a large graph (over 1000 nodes and edges)
	Also test that the motif card works, and that clicking on the "Show motif 		instance" button highlights the motif in the graph. Should show button(s) that
	will allow for the navigation through motif instances below the main network.

Test 3: Size 5 Motif
	Tests the above plus the button/paging functionality that is displayed when more
	than 6 motifs are present in an input nemoCollect file.
	*Note: these motifs are not necessarily the correct classification of motifs as
	that were created manually for testing.

Test 4: Size 8 Motif
	Same as above for the max motif size allowed. 
	*Note: these motifs are not necessarily the correct classification of motifs as
	that were created manually for testing.
